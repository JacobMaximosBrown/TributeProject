    <h3>The Prelude</h3>
    <p id="prelude">In 2017 a team within the NBA (National Basketball Organization) known as the Utah Jazz finished their regular season winning a surprising amount of 51 games led by a young Duo of Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward, but that duo wouldn’t last long. During the 2017 Playoffs the Utah Jazz were able to overcome odds and upset the favored Los Angeles Clippers, led by Chris Paul. The Jazz were able to make it to the second round but were easily dispatched by the eventual champion Golden State Warriors. The Off-season was very important to the Utah Jazz, due to it being their All Star Gordon Haywards free agency, and that resulted in him leaving Utah for the Boston Celtics. The effect of Gordon Hayward leaving Utah for nothing was supposed to leave Utah as one of the worst teams in the league, however on rookie player drafted surprisingly embraced the challenge, and beat all odds. His name is Donovan Mitchell.</p>

    <h3>The start of something great</h3>
    <p>Donovan Mitchell didn’t start right out of the gate as the “savior” the Utah Jazz needed, but he showed from day one he had the potential to do so. Donovan Mitchell gradually increased his level of play until he was named the starter for Utah in december of 2017, where he took off from and never looked back. Donovan Mitchell was in the run for the Rookie of the year, which he would lose to Ben Simmons due to his slow start. Donovan took all of the negativity from losing the Rookie Of The Year and proved that he was the better player than his rival by pulling up one of the biggest upsets in basketball history by beating the Oklahoma City THunder led by Superstars Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and former All Star Carmelo Anthony. Donovan Mitchell's rookie year was just the start of his fantastic career on and off of the court.</p>
